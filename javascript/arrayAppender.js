/* Write a function called appendArrays that appends the items 
from array 2 onto array 1, returning the newly formed array.

For example if your 2 arrays were:
var array1 = [a,b,c]
var array2 = [1,2,3]

After using your appendArrays function, the result should be [a,b,c,1,2,3]

Your function should also be able to handle nested arrays.*/
