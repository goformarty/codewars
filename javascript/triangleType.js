/* In this kata, you should calculate type of triangle with three given sides a, b and c (given in any order).

If all angles are less than 90째, this triangle is acute and function should return 1.

If one angle is strictly 90째, this triangle is right and function should return 2.

If one angle more than 90째, this triangle is obtuse and function should return 3.

If three sides cannot form triangle, or one angle is 180째 (which turns triangle into segment) - function should return 0.

Input parameters are sides of given triangle. All input values are non-negative floating point or integer numbers (or both).
